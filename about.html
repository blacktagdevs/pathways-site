          The Pathways Scholarship was established to foster creative thinkers and innovators
          who positively impact their communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that every student has the potential to make meaningful contributions to society,
          whether through scientific discovery, technological innovation, or creative expression.
          Our scholarship program is designed to identify and support those students who demonstrate
          not only academic excellence but also a genuine commitment to service and leadership.
        </p>
        <p>
          By providing financial support to Westover High School seniors pursuing higher education,
          we aim to remove barriers and encourage students to pursue their passions while making a
          positive difference in the world around them.
