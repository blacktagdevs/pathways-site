                  <strong>Yes!</strong> Pre-Medical Studies and Nursing are explicitly included as eligible
                  STEM pathways for the Pathways Scholarship. We recognize the importance of healthcare

                  The Pathways Scholarship specifically focuses on supporting students pursuing pathways
                  centered on creation and production—whether that's building technology, conducting scientific
                  research, or creating art. While we value liberal arts education, this particular scholarship
                  was designed with a specific focus. We encourage students pursuing liberal arts to seek other
                  scholarship opportunities that align with their fields.
